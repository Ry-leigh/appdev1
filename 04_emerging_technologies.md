# Quantum Computing

## Purpose
The main purpose of Quantum Computing is to solve problems that are too complex for traditional computers, by using the principles of quantum mechanics like **superposition and entanglement**. Instead of just working with 0s and 1s, quantum computers use qubits, which can be both at the same time. This makes them extremely powerful for tasks like large-scale simulations, cryptography, optimization, and data analysis. In education, it's not just about building future tech experts it’s about helping teachers and students use **smarter tools** such as personalized support, better assessment, and AI that’s been trained faster behind the scenes; in IT, it’s about pushing performance to levels we never had before.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
  Quantum computing is being introduced in universities and schools to help students understand next-generation computing. Some use interactive learning platforms and games to make quantum concepts easier, like **Quantum Odyssey** and **QUAVER**. Many institutions also give cloud-based access to real quantum computers like **IBM Quantum Experience**, so students can try out actual quantum programs without needing expensive lab equipment.

- **In IT**:  
  In IT, quantum computing is used for complex simulations (e.g., drug discovery, materials research), improving optimization processes, and even working on quantum-safe cryptography. Companies use cloud quantum platforms like **Microsoft Azure Quantum** and **Amazon Braket** to experiment with quantum algorithms without needing their own hardware.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)** installed a 127-qubit IBM quantum computer right on campus. This gives students direct, hands-on access to quantum hardware, growing their quantum club membership from about 40 to over 400 students in under a year.

- **In IT**:  
  **IBM** and **Cleveland Clinic** are working together to use quantum computing for healthcare research, aiming to speed up medical discoveries by simulating complex biological processes that classical computers can’t handle efficiently.
